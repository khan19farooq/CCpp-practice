The C language - 

* C is a robust language whose rich set of operators and functions can be used to write any simple to complex program.
* C compiler allows to write both "assembly language programming" along with "C programming code" and this allows to 
  write both system and application software(business packages).
* Programs written in c are efficient and fast.

C Program Compilation and Execution Process -

* The source of a C program is stored in a file with .c extension name.
* On Compilation it produces object code. 
* This object file is linked by linker (either static and dynamic) and a binary executable code is generated.
* The default binary output is named as a.exe on windows environments. So, type a.exe and run it. 

C Program -

* Any C program is basically a collection of functions that are supported by the C library. User defined functions can be
  created and added to the C library, if needed.
* The main () function is a special function used by the C language to instruct the platform/computer where the program starts.
* The set of statements belonging to a function are enclosed within a pair of braces, {}.
* Any variable used in the program must be declared before using it. For ex, use variables of a function right before starting the function.
* C program variables are generally written in lowercase letters (or CamelCase).
* Statements are terminated by a semicolon.
* Uppercase letters are used only for symbolic constants.

Constants, Variable, Identifiers and Keywords -

* Constants - they do not change during the execution of a program. 
* Variables - they change during the execution of a program.
* Identifiers -  they are user defined names given to variables, functions, pointers and arrays.
* Keywords - they are well known words whose meaning has already been explained to the compiler.
